"""Referee for the asset-turnover-service figures.

The figures come from the Rust library when its extension is installed; the Python
maths stays in this file's neighbour as the reference implementation and as the
fallback for images built without the wheel. tests/test_assurance_seam.py holds the
two to the same answers.

VIMBAI_CALC_ENGINE selects the engine: "auto" (default) uses Rust when it is
available, "rust" refuses to start without it, "python" pins the reference.
