# Changelog

Notable changes, newest first. Format follows Keep a Changelog; versions follow semantic versioning.

The project is pre-1.0 while the roadmap in `docs/ROADMAP.md` is incomplete. 1.0.0 lands with the close-out phase.

## [Unreleased]

### Added

- `docs/ROADMAP.md`: the ordered plan this repository is worked to, with a measured baseline and per-phase exit criteria.
- `docs/decisions/`: ADR-001 language policy, ADR-002 ledger authority, ADR-003 modular platform, ADR-004 API versioning,
  ADR-005 Vimbai Pay not built, ADR-006 developer platform deferred, ADR-008 directory naming.
- `docs/architecture/` and `docs/migration/` receive the existing layout and migration documents as historical snapshots.
- Repository gates in `rust/xtask`: catalogue generation, gateway address audit, module reachability, plus the
  repository-rules suite.

### Changed

- Documentation index established in `docs/README.md`; contributing guide rewritten for Safe Rust, Go and Dart.

## [0.1.0] - 2026-11-14

### Added

- Rust engine serving all 137 routed services; Go gateway in `gateway/go`; Flutter application in `apps/flutter`.
- `rust/apps/local-runtime`: the on-device runtime, one binary and one data directory, with a file-backed store that
  survives a restart and the gateway's three rules enforced in process.
- `catalog/services/catalog.yaml`: canonical inventory generated from the gateway route table and ownership.
- `rust/xtask`: catalogue, gateway address audit, reachability and repository rules as Rust gates.

### Removed

- All Python: 141 service directories, the pytest suite, the PyO3 extension and its wheel, `scripts/` helpers,
  `vimbai_local/`, `data/migrations`, SDK generation, and every requirements, pytest and lint configuration file.
- Per-service Kubernetes deployments, the 132-image build matrix, and the workflow jobs that ran them.

### Changed

- Ledger integrity decided by `crates/kernel/ledger-core` with exact `Money`; the float tolerance path is gone.
- Journal lines stored as records joined to their entry, linked to their account by edges, with the wire shape unchanged.
